# Flipping-Bits
in the [HackerRank Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)

### Challenge
> You will be given a list of 32 bit unsigned integers. Flip all the bits (1 -> 0 and 0 -> 1) and return the result as an unsigned integer.

### Explanation

> Take 1 for example, as unsigned 32-bits is 00000000000000000000000000000001
> and doing the flipping we get 11111111111111111111111111111110 which in turn is 4294967294.
